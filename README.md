# Data Mining and Discovery

## Analysis of shootings records

#### Objectives
1. Statistical exploration of shootings data using data mining methods for data preprocessing and analysis
2. Formulate null hypothesis and alternate hypothesis
3. Observe for associations between items in dataset using Apriori algorithm to mine
4. Draw correlations and independence between categorical and continuous variables to detect relationships between variables and identify redundant attributes in dataset
5. Pearson's correlation coefficient analysis on numeric attributes
6. Run models for prediction


#### Models used
Random Forest, Decision Tree
